# How Long Since Then
## Introduction
My Electron-based app to calculate how long since a past time to now. The main purpose is to learn how to use Electron writing multi-platform app.

I never use JavaScript, HTML and CSS before so my code may be really bad. Besides that, i write this code just to relax in my free time so it may be a little dirty and there's bug here and there. Hope you can help me improve it.

Sorry for my bad English.

## Web version
I don't develop web version anymore (not enought time and server problem). But if you want a peak into this app, you can visit [HowLongSinceThen Web](http://cretacam.ddns.net/nguyen).
